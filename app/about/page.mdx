**Enough BS, wtf is wcu?**

Wild Chicken University (also known as a diploma mill or degree mill) is an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas with substandard or no academic study and without recognition by official educational accrediting bodies. The purchaser can then claim to hold an academic degree, and the organization is motivated by making a profit. These degrees are often awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some such organizations claim accreditation by non-recognized/unapproved accrediting bodies set up for the purposes of providing a veneer of authenticity. While the terms "degree mill" and "diploma mill" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn: 

- A "degree mill" issues "real" diplomas from non regionally accredited "universities", which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate universities. 
- A "diploma mill" issues counterfeit diplomas which bear the names of legitimate universities.
