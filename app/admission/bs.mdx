We realize you've been anxiously awaiting your decision from Wild Chicken and want to let you know that your application status will never be "under review". (You might realize that this is copied from UC Berkeley's email)

We do understand how bad you feel when you get a rejection letter from the university, that's why we won't say “We regret that we are unable to offer you admission.”

NO fees💰️ to apply. NO supplements📝 to submit. NO extra essays to write.
Screw flywire, nobody likes your currency conversion rate
